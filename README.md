## Hi, I'm Chris.

By day, I work at the [International Association of Certified Home Inspectors (InterNACHI)](https://www.nachi.org) as both the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer. InterNACHI is a professional association for home inspectors that focuses on using technology to deliver the best education, testing, and certification available to the home inspection industry.

While the vast majority of my time is dedicated to InterNACHI (and helping other organizations like it), I'm a programmer at heart and still contribute frequently to open source projects.
